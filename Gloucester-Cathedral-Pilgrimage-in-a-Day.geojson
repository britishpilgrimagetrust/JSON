Chantries commemorate the dead through chanting for their souls, and were abolished in the 16th century and the chapel ceased to be used for worship. The existence of this smaller Saxon chapel nearby was unknown until 1865 when the Revd George Butterworth rediscovered it. Two clues helped him. The first was an entry in the medieval chronicle of Tewkesbury Abbey describing a church dedicated to the Holy Trinity that stood opposite the gateway to Deerhurst Priory. The second was the famous Odda Stone that had been found in an orchard near the parish church in 1675.
