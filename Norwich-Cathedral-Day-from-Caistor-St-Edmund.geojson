It starts at the site of a Roman camp and town at Caistor St Edmund, where a church founded in the Saxon era sits in the south-east corner. Some of the church's fabric dates back to the 11th century, and the earliest written record dates from the reign of Edward the Confessor. The route then traces through fields towards the city, stopping to make an important detour to the shrine of the renowned anchorite Lady Julian, in St Julian's Church. It then continues on to Norwich Cathedral itself.]]>","number":1}}
