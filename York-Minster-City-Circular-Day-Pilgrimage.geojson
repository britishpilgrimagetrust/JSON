William was canonized by Pope Honorius III in 1224, with several miracles attributed to his intercession including the lack of injury after the collapse of the Ouse Bridge.On St. William’s Feast Day, June 8, small services are still held in the Western Crypt, and the area around the tomb is used as an area of public quiet reflection. King Edwin of Deira, who was in control of York, married the Christian princess Ethelburga of Kent. As part of the marriage agreement, Ethelburga persuaded her new husband to convert to Christianity. A small wooden church was built for the baptism of Edwin .This church is thought to be the first one built in the area of the current Minster, so it's often considered  to be 'the first Minster'.  Only churches that have their origins in the Saxon period are referred to as ‘Minsters’. the font stands in the centre of the crypt as you enter.
