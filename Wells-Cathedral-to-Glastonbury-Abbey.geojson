A labyrinth is impressed in the hillside of the Tor for circumambulation, which takes about 5 hours (we recommend finding a guide to help), or you can walk up the Pilgrim’s Path along the spine. Some say that the lighting and colors change as the pilgrim progresses up the hill, with the grass and sky becoming more vibrant and intense. The strange, conical form, often rising like an island on a foggy day, has been the subject of much speculation and inquiry. Is it a chamber to another world? A fairy fort? St Michael's Tower, atop the tor, is open to the sky. It forms a spine of towers dedicated to St. Michael (who, being an angel, loves high places) all the way to Mont St. Michel in France. The nearest to Glastonbury is Burrowbridge Mound, and St. Michael’s Mount in Cornwall is also along this line. On his feast day, torches were lit from shrine to shrine. One day, standing in the tower, I had a hunch that it was the same arch looking out over the landscape that William Blake depicted in his book, Jerusalem: The Emanation of the Giant Albion (1804 – c. 1820), which has long-been compared to the illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages, in both form and function. The frontispiece depicts a pilgrim stepping beyond the page into the dark expanse of the book itself, an illusion created through a masterful application of paint. Around the borders are broken chains (Blake invited his readers to cast off their “mind-forg’d manacles” and enter, as pilgrim explorers, the recesses of their own imaginations).Late in his life a group of young artists called the Shoreham Ancients befriended Blake. One of them, Samuel Palmer, created this etching (c/o the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC) inspired by Milton’s Il Penseroso, ‘Or let my lamp at midnight hour,/Be seen in some high lonely tow’r,/Where I may oft out-watch the Bear,/With thrice-great Hermes, or unsphere’. The tower is reminiscent of the one on the Tor, and if you look closely you can see pilgrims making their way to the top. The roofless-ness also makes it perfect for stargazing! (https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.73572.html) The tower itself is an ancient symbol of Divine Wisdom and thoughtful isolation. There are medieval resonances in the story of St Barbara imprisoned in a tower where she was converted to Christianity by inspiration. In Milton’s day, the tower was used in emblem books to signify light and vigilance in the face of danger. A 1632 woodcut shows a pilgrim embarking on a difficult and labyrinthine route to a tower (on which sits an angel, helping them along) with a quotation from Psalm 1119.5, ‘Oh that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes’.The Lonely Tower became an important symbol in Yeats’s poem, the Phases of the Moon. He writes of...the candle lightFrom the far tower where Milton’s PlatonistSat late, or Shelley’s visionary prince:The lonely light that Samuel Palmer engraved,An image of mysterious wisdom won by toil. You may feel a lot of emotion coming to this place. To many, it feels like coming home. To others, it feels like a place of the heart.

One of the most famous symbols of baptism and also pilgrimage is the scallop shell, usually shown on images of St. James as a pilgrim, and often attached to bags and hats (even today) to indicate that a walker is on a religious pilgrimage rather than a ramble in the woods. The scallop can also be found in church iconography and baptismal fonts as a symbol of baptism and, moreover, spiritual renewal. Pause for a moment here at this place dedicated to St. John and remember his pilgrim journey; ‘the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.’ Speaking of pilgrim paths, take a moment to walk the seven-circuit Glastonbury Tercentenniel Labyrinth in the garden (http://www.stjohns-glastonbury.uk/docs/docs/labyrith_brochure%5b1%5d1_stjgl1000021.pdf?fbclid=IwAR08aENMMQm1tyKQzVhI_yzQ1b6KcyISySi4f45PzOECO1kyRusU50Rfrv4).

Some eighteenth-century artists who came to sketch the ruins spoke of the stones themselves being imbued with the voices of the monks who chanted there long ago…can you hear them? According to legend, Saint Joseph of Arimathea, who gave up his tomb for Jesus, travelled first to Gaul and then Britain in the year 63 AD. In one version of the story, he was accompanied by the child Christ, who built a model church out of twigs (described in a letter from St Augustine of Canterbury to Pope Gregory), and in another Joseph brought the Gospel and the Holy Grail to the island after the Resurrection, to which he bore witness. You can see an illuminated miniature of Joseph collecting some of Christ’s blood in the chalice used at the last supper in this L'estoire del Saint Graal (c. 1316) now at the British Library (bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/ILLUMIN.ASP?Size=mid&IllID=60305).William Blake famously recalled this in his preface to his illuminated book Milton, in a lyric later set to music by Sir Hubert Parry and now known as ‘Jerusalem’, which asks, ‘And did those feet in ancient time/Walk upon Englands mountains green?’ (https://britishpilgrimage.org/2016/10/jerusalem-pilgrimage-2016/). Lesser known than the famous hymn are Blake’s other depictions of the subject, for example this 1809 engraving of Joseph, (https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/P_1864-0611-3), the sacred artist blazing a pilgrim trail to Avalon (note the ‘Joseph of Arimathea among The Rocks of Albion’ graffito inscribed on the face of the rock itself). The landscape of Glastonbury around the Tor is believed to have been surrounded by the sea, which is reflected in Blake’s pictorial setting. He also created this watercolour of Joseph preaching to the inhabitants of Britain under the thorn tree that sprung from his staff, which we will visit next (https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.11490.html).But before we do so, the Abbey has also had other illustrious visitors; for example, Saint Patrick, who was said to have visited in 443. St. Dunstan was appointed Abbot around 943 and reformed the monastic life there. He illuminated manuscripts and played harp within the walls of his 5-foot cell against the old Church of St. Mary. He is said to have been tempted by the devil there and resisted by grabbing his nose with a pair of blazing hot pinchers. Before leaving, be sure to visit the site of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere’s tomb, said to have been discovered in a hollow oak between two great stone pyramids with a leaden plaque which stated, ‘Here lies buried the glorious king Arthur and Guinevere his second wife in the Isle of Avalon.’ ]]>","desc":"<![CDATA[To get to the Abbey, pass through the medieval portal on Magdalen Street.
