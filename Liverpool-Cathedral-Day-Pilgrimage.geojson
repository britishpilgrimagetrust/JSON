Starting to the east of the city the route begins beside a curious monolith, known as Robin Hood's Stone, which shows signs of carving from the Bronze Age and is thought to be linked to the more extensive Calder Stones, the next highlight of this walk. Housed in the Harthill greenhouse in Calderstones park, the Calder Stones are the remains of a chambered tomb, a reminder of the ways in which ritual memorialisation of death has been a constant feature of very long human history. Just near the stones is the city's venerable Allerton Oak, voted as England's Tree of the Year in 2019 in homage to its 1,000 years of living natural history. The walk proceeds to the Monk's Well at Wavertree, where a medieval well housing stands somewhat incongruously in a modern suburban setting. A 15th-century inscription added by its one-time guardian still warns visitors today to show respect to the spiritual power of the well (while hinting rather unsubtly that tossing in a coin would not go amiss either), translated from the Latin as: \"'He who here does nought bestow, The Devil laughs at him below\". Moving to into central Liverpool, the route first visits the city's Roman Catholic cathedral, commonly called the Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral, and then walks down Hope Street towards the Anglican cathedral, which it reaches after a short detour to visit the magnificent 19th-century Princes Road Synagogue, adding some inter-faith colour to this ecumenical pairing of Christian cathedrals.]]>","number":1}}
