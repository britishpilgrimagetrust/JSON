Saltford, we head uphill across farmland to the historic Kelston Roundhill, with stunning views (on a clear day!) across Bristol to Wales. We join the Cotswold Way briefly, which takes us to another panoramic viewpoint at Bath Racecourse. This is followed by a couple of miles of level walking across farmland before we begin the descent into Bath.Tucked into the hillside above Bath, St Mary’s Charlcombe is the oldest ecclesiastical building in Bath still in use today. In St Mary’s peaceful quiet garden you’ll find a holy well fed by a fresh-water spring.The final stretch of the route includes Bath’s famous architectural gems: the Royal Crescent, Circus and Assembly Rooms, finishing at the Roman Baths and Bath Abbey.There are good public transport connections between Keynsham, Saltford and Bath.You can find food and drink on route at pubs and cafes in Saltford, Kelston and Lansdown, as well as numerous pubs and cafes in Keynsham and Bath.]]>","number":1}},
