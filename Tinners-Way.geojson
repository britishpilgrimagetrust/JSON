The route was created after the discovery of ancient shipping rosters proving that pilgrims historically came to Lelant by sea on their way to Santiago de Compostela, and travelled over land to Marazion to avoid the waters of Lands End. St Michael’s Way is the only pilgrimage route in Britain that is officially part of a European Cultural Route. It is a genuine British leg of the Camino to Santiago!]]>"}},
