The young prince St Wigstan was martyred in 849AD, the church in Wistow marking the place where he was slain. The royal blood that was shed reputedly causes human hair to grow among the grass in the churchyard on 1 June, the anniversary of his death, a 12th century legend that speaks volumes of the medieval imagination. The pilgrimage heads north through fields, passing the medieval church of St Luke's, before emerging into Leicester's suburbs and the final stretch into the city centre past memorials to another royal victim of bloodshed. King Richard III's remains were uncovered in a car park in 2012, and reverently buried in the nearby Leicester Cathedral in 2015, where his tomb can be visited today.]]>","number":1}},
