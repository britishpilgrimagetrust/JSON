Heading north from here the pleasant riverside path meanders its way to St Stephen's Church in Tockholes, where another stone curiosity awaits. Thought to be the stump of an Anglo-Saxon cross, Tocca's Stone stands in the churchyard, above a plinth with a medieval inscription, while a unique outdoor pulpit can be found nearby. The route then heads north, mostly avoiding roads in favour of lanes and farmland paths to the southern outskirts of Blackburn, where it picks up a section of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal before arriving at the cathedral itself.]]>","number":1}}
