this pilgrim route between the two is given over to contemplation of less formal spiritual matters: sustainability and some interesting public artworks. Although lacking major religious sites on its journey, this route follows the Spen Valley Greenway, which has won international prizes for its innovative reuse of a former railway line, making for a safe and convenient journey on foot or by bicycle. Artworks include a flock of Swaledale sheep constructed of scrap metal and a series of hoops set in a circle, popular with the many cyclists who are attracted to this traffic-free route. After arriving in Bradford itself a short detour to the Peace Museum, a few steps from the cathedral doors, is a final option for reflection before the pilgrim's journey is over.]]>","number":2}},
